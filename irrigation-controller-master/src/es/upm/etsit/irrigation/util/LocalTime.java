/**
 * A time without time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 * such as {@code 10:15:30}.
 * <p>
 * {@code LocalTime} is an immutable date-time object that represents a time,
 * often viewed as hour-minute-second.
 * Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
 * For example, the value "13:45.30.123456789" can be stored in a {@code LocalTime}.
 * <p>
 * It does not store or represent a date or time-zone.
 * Instead, it is a description of the local time as seen on a wall clock.
 * It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
 * such as an offset or time-zone.
 * <p>
 * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 * in most of the world. This API assumes that all calendar systems use the same
 * representation, this class, for time-of-day.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 * class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 * ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 * {@code LocalTime} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 * The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
